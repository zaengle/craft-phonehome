# Introduction

> Monitor the status of your #CraftCMS projects remotely

## What

Phonehome provides a secure API endpoint that returns comprehensive information about a Craft CMS installation and the server environment it is installed in.

## Why?

If like us, you manage a large number of production Craft CMS installations, you know how important it is to keep track of their health and status. Phonehome allows you to monitor your Craft sites from a single dashboard, providing insights into their performance, uptime, and configuration.

## How it works

Usage of this plugin requires an external service to monitor your Craft sites and view their status.

You can use the [Zaengle Phone Home service](https://phone-home.zaengle.com) to register your Craft sites and view their status. This free service provides a dashboard where you can see all your registered sites, their health status, and other useful information.

Using the Zaengle Phone Home service is entirely optional, and you can also use the plugin to create your own custom dashboard or integrate it with your existing monitoring tools. The schema of the API response is documented in the [API documentation](./03-api.md)
